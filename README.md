> Run linters on committed files of a GIT BranchðŸ”¬

## Getting Started ðŸ”®

This package will run linters on your project for the committed files in your branch.

### PrerequisitesðŸ”­

It require Node.js v6 or newer. It also requires a package to manage git hooks. I strongly suggest [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) which I use for most of my projects.


```js
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm test",
      "pre-push": "npm test",
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing

* This project requires a package to manage git hooks depending.
* I strongly suggest [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) which pauses the git push by overriding pre-commit hook (it almost overrides all hooks, here we need only pre-push hook) and allow us to run our custom scripts and resumes pushing.


### npm

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-prepush
```

or using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add --dev husky lint-prepush
```

### Usage

Configure the following scripts in package.json to lint your committed files ðŸ”§. You can also follow any of the  [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) methods to configure lint-prepush.

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
+   "prepush": "lint-prepush"
  },
+ "lint-prepush": {
+   "base": "master",
+    "tasks": {
+      "*.js": [
+        "eslint"
+      ]
+    }
+  }
}
```

### Output Colors

In case the default output colors don't render well in your terminal, you can adjust them
by adding a `theme` configuration Object to the `lint-prepush` configuration.

You can use any of the default `keyword`s available in [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk),
and you can override a one, two, or all three of the colors.

The default theme is:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "success": "green",
    "error": "red",
    "warning": "orange"
  }
}
```

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepush": "lint-prepush"
  },
  "lint-prepush": {
    "base": "master",
    "tasks": {
      "*.js": [
        "eslint"
      ]
+    },
+    "theme": {
+       "warning": "gray",
+       "error": "orange",
+       "success": "blue"
+    }
  }
}
```

The above scrips will lint the js files while pushing to git. It will terminate the process if there are any errors, otherwise, the changes will be pushed.
